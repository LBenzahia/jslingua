# Contribution Guidelines

Here are some few guidelines on how to be part of this project.

## Tags meanings

In this project, we use a specific set of tags, in issues and change-log:
* NEW: For any new module or file (creation)
* ADD: For any functions added inside a module (addition)
* IMPROVE: For any improvements to existing materials.
This affects the behavior, but doesn't break any precedent
* MODIFY: Modification of function names, files names and directories.
This will break the projects developed on precedent versions.
* FIX: Fixing bugs
* DEL: Delete or deprecate some functions
